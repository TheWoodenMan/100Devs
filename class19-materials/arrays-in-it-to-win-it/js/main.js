//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

const cheerleaders = [
  "Bring it On",
  "Bring it on Again",
  "Fight to the Finish",
];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

const bringItOn = cheerleaders[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const cheerleadersLenght = cheerleaders.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable.
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index?
//  Would your solution still work?

const fightToTheFinish = cheerleaders[2];

// no it wouldnt but you could use cheerleaders.length -1 to do it instead
